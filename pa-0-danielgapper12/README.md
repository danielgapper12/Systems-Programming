# CPTS 360: Programming Assignment 0 - Unix Filesystem Simulator

This repository contains my solution for Programming Assignment 0 from CPTS 360 (Systems Programming). The objective of this project was to simulate a simplified Unix filesystem using C, focusing on the use of pointers, linked lists, and trees.

## Project Overview

The program simulates the structure and commands of a Unix filesystem. It supports basic commands like mkdir, rmdir, cd, ls, pwd, creat, rm, save, reload, and quit. These commands allow the user to create directories, manage files, navigate the filesystem, and save or reload the current state.

## Key Features
#### Unix-like Filesystem
Simulates a Unix directory tree with files and directories.
#### Command Implementation
Supports commands such as mkdir, rmdir, cd, ls, creat, and more.
#### Persistence
Allows saving and reloading the filesystem structure to/from a file.
#### C Programming Concepts
Implemented using pointers, linked lists, and tree structures.
## Skills Demonstrated

Proficiency in C programming, particularly in managing complex data structures like trees and linked lists.
Understanding of Unix-style file management and filesystem concepts.
Command parsing and error handling.
