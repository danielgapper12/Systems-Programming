# CPTS 360: Programming Assignment 1 - Cache Memory Simulation

This repository contains my solution for Programming Assignment 1 from CPTS 360 (Systems Programming). The goal of this project was to simulate the behavior of a cache memory system, analyzing hit, miss, and eviction patterns based on given memory traces.

## Project Overview

The cache simulator is implemented in C and simulates the hit/miss behavior of a cache memory using an LRU (Least Recently Used) replacement policy. It takes memory access traces (generated by Valgrind) as input and outputs the total number of cache hits, misses, and evictions.

## Key Features
#### Command-Line Input
Accepts cache parameters (number of sets, associativity, and block size) and trace file via command-line arguments.
#### Verbose Mode
Displays detailed memory access trace information including hits, misses, and evictions.
#### Cache Simulation
Tracks hits, misses, and evictions based on the cache configuration and memory access patterns.
## Skills Demonstrated

Proficiency in C programming, especially in dynamic memory allocation and data structure management using malloc.
Understanding of cache memory behavior and LRU replacement policy.
Command-line argument parsing using getopt and handling various input/output operations.
